## Context

JamPy is an open-source implementation of the JAM protocol using the Python language, developed by Davide Gessa and released under "Apache License 2.0".

The deliverable includes a binary distribution of the target and fuzzer for graypaper version 0.7.0. The code is still not publicly available, but please contact to get access to the repo.


## Deliverables

- [x] 1. IMPORTER: State-transitioning conformance tests pass and can import blocks.
- [ ] 2. AUTHOR: Fully conformant and can produce blocks (including networking, off-chain).
- [ ] 3. HALF-SPEED: Conformance and Kusama-level performance (including PVM implementation).
- [ ] 4. FULL-SPEED: Conformance and Polkadot-level performance (including PVM implementation).
- [ ] 5. SECURE: Fully audited.
